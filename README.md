# Test Covid Servise

## Description:

This is a test.

The test is to create a servise to filter the information from a web json API and offer the results as a web json API.

## Development:

Since the only thing I knew about Express is that it is a Node.js backend framework, I started by watching some YouTube videos:

* [Express JS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE).
* [LEARN EXPRESS JS IN 15 MINUTES!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlgKybraoy4).
* [Making HTTP Requests from NodeJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh7opViDFMo).
* [How To Make an HTTP Request In Node.js Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MouZdENJddQ).
